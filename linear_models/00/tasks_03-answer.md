Homework 3, Answer following questions:
-----
1. For which tasks is it better to use Logistic Regression instead of other models?
 -- LR is the right choice for classification tasks
2. What are the most important parameters that you can tune in Linear Regression / Logistic Regression / SVM?
 -- Learning rate has its own importance in Gradient Descent, regularization parameter also
3. How does parameter C influence regularisation in Logistic Regression?
 -- If the parameter is too large, the coefficients will be very small, which is bad for the approximation. 
 Overfitting vs. Underfitting in other words.
4. Which top 3 features are the most important for each data sets?
Medical Cost [smoker, age, bmi]

5. Which accuracy metrics did you receive on train and test sets for `Heart Disease UCI` dataset?
 -- train 0.85 test set: 0.80
6. Which MSE did you receive on train and test datasets for `Medical Cost Personal`? 
 -- train: 0.66 test set: 0.62
6. *(additional)** Try a few different models and compare them. <i>(You can use scikit-learn models for this)</i>
