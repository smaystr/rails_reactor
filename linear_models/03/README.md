1. LogReg shows its best, when working with classification with data, 
  which has some linear dependencies

2. - C - regulization parametr
   - number of iterations 
   - learning rate
   - metric
   - regulization type

3. C param controls the regulization strength (C = 1 / alpha).
  So, lowering C means strengthen regulization 

4. For heart dataset:
    - cp      
    - slope   
    - thalach 
   
   For insurance dataset:
    - smoker 
    - age    
    - bmi    

5. Accuracy for heart dataset:
    - test:  0.8360655737704918
    - train: 0.8388429752066116

6. MSE for insurance dataset:
    - test:  33677590.89434726
