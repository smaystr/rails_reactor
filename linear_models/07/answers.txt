1. For which tasks is it better to use Logistic Regression instead of other models?

Mostly for classification tasks. Generally, Logistic Regression models are to predict the probability of a 
certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick.

2. What are the most important parameters that you can tune in Linear Regression / Logistic Regression / SVM?

Linear Regression:
C - inverse regularization parameter

Logistic Regression:
C - inverse regularization parameter

SVM:
Different SVM Kernels,
C - inverse regularization parameter,
Epsilon - determines the level of accuracy of the approximated function.

3. How does parameter C influence regularisation in Logistic Regression?

While C is increasing the regularization level is decreasing. Cause of reverse proportion.
And if C is decreasing the regularization level is increasing. 

4. Which top 3 features are the most important for each data sets?

(from model theta)
