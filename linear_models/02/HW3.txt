1. Logistic Regression models are quite fast and easily interpretable and is less prone to overfitting. Worth using to predict probabilities instead of classes. 
2. Most important parameters are learning rate, regularization rate, C
3. Hyperparameter C is the inverse regularization term. Smaller values specify stronger regularization
4. Most important features heart diseas dataset: sex, cp, thal
Most important features medical cost dataset: smoker, age, bmi
